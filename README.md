# moderngl.js

This is an early experiment to bring moderngl to the web.

The first implementation will be slightly different from the moderngl Python API, but the basic program and vertex array structure remains the same.

The current implementation uses WebGL2. In the future we might switch to WebGPU.

The current status of moderngl.js (moderngl on web) is draft.

Please come back later for more information.
